Road Data was obtained from:
          https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php?year=2018&layergroup=Roads
          
Files are named :
	StateFipsCode-interstate.json
	StateFipsCode-interstate-labels.json

The labels are seperate because they use centroid cordinates and are consolidated
					 
I converted it to JSON data ustilizing OSGeo.OGR library and simplified data with Simplify(0.001);

The maps load a tad slower than MaPBox, and I noticed the data from Tiger/Line seems to have a 
lot of difference in names and coordinates than MapBox; look at Alabama and Mississippi's I-22, and you will see a big chucnk of highway missing. I tested this prior to simplifying the geometries, and it yielded the same result.

What I did to remedy this is change US Hwy 78 to I- 22 US Hwy 78

Railroad Data was obtained from:
		https://cta.ornl.gov/transnet/RailRoads.html

Files are named:
	StateFipsCode-CTA-RR.json

The file contains features and labels, combined. I could not find a way to link rails continuously unless grouping by name. According to documentation, the JA and JB fields,
should point to a daisy chain like connecting points. Similarily, when I tried to get 
data from Tiger/Line, I used a similar stratgey, the lines look ok, like on other maps; but to get a continuous legend, not so easy.
